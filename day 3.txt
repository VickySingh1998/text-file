1. 

$ touch abc.txt def.txt  (it will create 2 .txt files that we need to move to a folder)
$ ls *.txt
abc.txt  def.txt  (to check if our txt files are ready or not)

$ for file in ls *.txt
> do
> echo $file
> done     
abc.txt
def.txt     ( to know if the files coming properly to move o folder name)

$ for file in ls *.txt
> do
> folderName=`echo $file | awk -F. '{print $1}'`;
> echo $folderName
> done
abc
def      (now we have extracted the folder name) 

$ for file in ls *.txt
> do
> folderName=`echo $file | awk -F. '{print $1}'`;
> mkdir $folderName;
> done  (now in this command we have finally made the directory) 

$ ls -p
abc/  abc.txt  def/  def.txt  helloworld.java  

$ for file in ls *.txt
> do
> folderName=`echo $file | awk -F. '{print $1}'`;
> rm -r $folderName;  (to make sure to remove the folder name because its already created and you want the shell run every time)
> mkdir $folderName;  (created the folder)
> cp $file $folderName; (copy the file in the folder)
> done

$ ls abc def
abc:
abc.txt

def:
def.txt    

2.

making a shell file so that we can modify and run the file without copy pasting every time

#!/bin/bash -x         (to run in a debug mode)
for file in ls *.txt
do
        folderName=`echo $file | awk -F. '{print $1}'`;
        rm -r $folderName;
        mkdir $folderName;
        cp $file $folderName;
done
ctrl+X

$ chmod +x copyfiles.sh  (adding execution to our file)

$ ls -l copyfiles.sh

-rwxr-xr-x 1 vicky 197609 157 May  6 01:05 copyfiles.sh* (now executable mode is activated because we want to run our file)

$ ./copyfiles.sh

++ ls abc.txt def.txt
+ for file in ls *.txt
++ echo abc.txt
++ awk -F. '{print $1}'
+ folderName=abc
+ rm -r abc
+ mkdir abc
+ cp abc.txt abc
+ for file in ls *.txt
++ echo def.txt
++ awk -F. '{print $1}'
+ folderName=def
+ rm -r def
+ mkdir def
+ cp def.txt def

3. 

#!/bin/bash -x
for file in ls *.txt
do
        folderName=`echo $file | awk -F. '{print $1}'`;
        if [ -d $folderName ]
        then
          rm -r $folderName;
        fi
        mkdir $folderName;
        cp $file $folderName;
done

we are doing this to put if then statement to run the execution if it finds a folder with same name it will remove it
and create and if it doesnt find anything it will just skip the rm command and execute.
